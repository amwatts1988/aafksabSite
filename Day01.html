                                <p>662, my order number, apparently becomes my registration number at CanSwecWest 2019. Do confrence bagdes work the same way memorbilia works?? Not that it really matters, but I usually struggle a bit when trying to come up with a catchy intro! Flying into the city was both very exciting and exhausting. I have never been called a 'foreigner' before now either... After a full nights rest, I hit the conference registration and breakfast, before heading straight to the Pwn2Own area of the event.</p>
                                <p>After finding the correct room, the scene was pretty much what you would expected to see. Groups of people sitting around tables, laptops open, going over past and present exploits from the competition. It would seem that everyone was very aware of any new presence in the space and when I walked in you could see the shift in attention on me.</p>
                                <p>After brief silence, the crowd returned to the semi overwhelming yet dull chatter. Corey, from Tesla was the first to approach me. We had a very cool conversation about my entry into Pwn2Own and how unfortunately, it did not qualify. It became clear how I misunderstood the rules as I was attacking the can bus to gain control of the infotainment system. After clearing that up&nbsp; He quickly offered to get me in front of a group of engineers from Tesla to talk about my exploit. More to come on this later!</p>
                                <p>It was very cool to be around my peers from the security community, especially when they are further along the same shared path as I am and willing to bring me along. One of the biggest takeaways from this first day is that I am a part of the security community! No judgments about hoodies, or beards either lol!!</p>
                                <p>The rest of the day was filled with rapid fire 1 hour sessions from Vendors, researchers, and anyone really who had something informative to say. I will be honest some of the topics are outside of my wheel house but I still gained a lot by seeing the process.</p>
                                <p>In my opinion, the process is probably more important than the actual outcome. I also recently read that its good to listen and read things outside of your current level of understanding. this way, you will 'discover' new or different details when facing a strange or difficult challenge and can recall back to 'that one thing you heard that one time'. At least it works well for me lol</p>
                                <p>That about sum's up the first day of activities, I will try and make a post each day with a wrap up to follow when I return back to the states. Tonight we have the Annual</p>
